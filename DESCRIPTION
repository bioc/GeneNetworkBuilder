Description: Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of transcription factors 
				using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq and microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data. 
				Inputting a list of genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, 
				and the microarray gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder generates a network map 
				to show the direct and indirect target genes regulated by the TF from the list.
