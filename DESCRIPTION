Description: Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of
        transcription factors using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and
        microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data. Inputting a list of
        genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or
        ChIP-seq, and the gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder
        generates a regulatory network of the TF.
