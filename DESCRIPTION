Description: Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of transcription factors 
		using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data. 
		Inputting a list of genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, 
		and the gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder generates a regulatory
		network of the TF.
