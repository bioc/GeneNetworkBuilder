#' Build Regulatory Network from ChIP-chip/ChIP-seq and Expression Data
#'
#' Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of
#' transcription factors using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and
#' microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data. Inputting a list of
#' genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or
#' ChIP-seq, and the gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder
#' generates a regulatory network of the TF.
